# Advent of Code 2021

Welcome to my attempt to actually complete advent of code this year!

"What's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)"?
TLDR; Small puzzles that release every day for the month of December up until Christmas.
Lots of people use Advent of Code to try out new languages, IDEs or compete with their friends.

"What's your goal for AOC 2021"
Well i'm glad ya asked. I'd like to accomplish a few things:

- ...finish for once
- be organized (actually commit my code to GitHub each day)
- write _clean_ solutions - I want to write code that I could explain/teach people easily.
  It can be more verbose and/or less efficient if it's easier to read and understand.
  If I'm feeling frisky some days we can do an easy to read version + some cooler 1-liners
- @ballpointcarrot has given me the courage to maybe live stream some of these. TBD

Let's get it.

Alright we got to Day 14 - Let's get further next year :)
